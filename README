Sneak peek of the new recode of Nimda3.

This is far from complete - not for productive use.

Install:

1) Create new MySQL-Database and add a user for the bot to it.
2) Change database auth in nimda.conf
3) Start Nimda with ./nimda

The bot will connect to irc.wechall.net, channel #nimda by default

SQL is autoupdated if there are any changes.

If you want to code for it - please only touch the plugins/user/ directory - everything else is under construction exclusively by me for now.
