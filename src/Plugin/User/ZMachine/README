This wrapper needs dfrotz from the frotz Z-code interpreter. Get it from https://github.com/DavidGriffith/frotz or http://frotz.sourceforge.net/

You probably need this patch to compile it on a current system: http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/games-engines/frotz/files/frotz-2.43-glibc2.10.patch

In order to use this plugin, dfrotz has to be installed.
If dfrotz is not in your $PATH, specify an absolute path in ZMachine.php via DFROTZ_PATH.

I only package Zork I here, but there are many more text adventures out there that work.
You can get the other Zork parts from: http://www.infocom-if.org/downloads/downloads.html
Many other games are available at: http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html

To add a game to Nimda, download the .DAT/.zX and put it in files/games/
Then add a .conf file for it in files/ - use ZORK1.conf as a template.
When both files are ready use "!zmachine update" in IRC to reload the game list.

Due to the amount of output in these games, this is best played on IRC servers without flood control.
